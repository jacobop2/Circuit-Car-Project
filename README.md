# Circuit-Car-Project
This project was completed in a team of four people, each responsible for different parts of the circuit which when completed, produced a functional car various capabilities. The most significant of which are speed control, turning, balance control, and sound recognition leading to motor reversal. For a detailed report of each function, read the final report. Also attached is the final project schematic that is fully original and created by our group during the construction of our car. Finally, the mic demo is attatched in which the capacitor's response to the mic being activated is measured with an online oscilloscope.
